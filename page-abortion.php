	<ul>
		<li>Abortion is an elective medical procedure that intentionally ends a pregnancy before the baby is born alive.</li>
		<li>In the U.S. today, approxi-mately 25% of all pregnancies end in abo-rtion, which equals 1.1 million abortions every year.  Worldwide ap-proximately 42 million abortions occur annually.</li>
		<li>US Supreme Court cases Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton ruled that it’s legal in 1973, and can be performed any time during pregnancy, right up until the baby is delivered.</li>
