	<h2 class="italic">AFL Positions</h2>

	<div class="grid">
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon abortion"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Abortion</h3>
			<p>
				Anglicans for Life believes that human beings are created in the image of God and that life begins at conception. Therefore, Anglicans for Life rejects abortion. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon contraception"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Contraception</h3>
			<p>
				Anglicans for Life does not have an official position on the issue of contraception. We encourage women and couples to prayerfully research and employ healthy and safe family planning methods.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon euthanasia"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Euthanasia</h3>
			<p>
				As the Creator of Life, God not only forms each person in the womb, but He decrees the number of days we will live. Therefore, AFL believes it is always wrong to hasten death via euthanasia or assisted suicide. We believe that death must happen naturally, neither artificially prolonging nor ending it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
				<div class="position-icon stem-cells"></div>
				<h3 class="italic">Stem-Cells</h3>
				<p>
					Anglicans for Life is in favor of research using non-embryonic stem cells because, while it is important to advance medical science, embryonic stem cell research kills living embryos.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon partial-birth-abortion"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Partial-Birth Abortion</h3>
			<p>
				Anglicans for Life strongly opposes partial birth abortion, as it not only ends a helpless life, but does so in a particularly cruel, disgusting, and violent way. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon post-abortion-aftercare"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Post-Abortion Aftercare</h3>
			<p>
				Healing and forgiveness are available through Jesus Christ for ALL sins, including abortion. Studies indicate that women who have had abortions, as well as their families, can suffer from physical, psychological, and spiritual trauma and desperately need to experience the grace of Jesus Christ in their lives.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon death-penalty"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Death Penalty</h3>
			<p>
				Anglicans for Life does not have an official position on the issue of the Capital Punishment. We mourn with families who have suffered, ask God to comfort those who are employed to enforce the death penalty, and turn to God to redeem the souls of those waiting punishment.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-1-2">
			<div class="position-icon adoption"></div>
			<h3 class="italic">Adoption</h3>
			<p>
				As children of God, we come into God s family through adoption. Therefore, as we have been adopted into Christ, AFL supports and affirms adopted children, adoptive parents, and birth parents.
