-re-balanced sizes & paddings
-position:absolute? Lots of use position:absolute throughout

3. Home > article
-re-balanced sizes & paddings
-header made smaller
-questionable use: <?php the_excerpt('Read More'); ?>
—not flexible, if need to add arrows or styling?

4. Home > article circles
-re-balanced sizes & paddings
-margin + padding —> just padding

5. Home > article social
-rebalanced sizes & paddings
-opacity made even lower
-removed drop-shadow when “off”
-missing white gradient fixed — present in code, but buggy CSS didn’t show it
-when active, box-shadow now disappears
-both <a> and inner <div> have class “icon”?
