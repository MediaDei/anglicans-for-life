	<h3 id="term-privacy-2">2. <span class="italic">How we share information</span></h3>
	<p class="privacy-p">
		AFL may occasionally share contact information gathered from subscribers with organizations or parties it considers to be supportive of its broader mission. AFL may also share information with trusted third-party vendors who contact you on behalf of AFL.
	</p>
	<p class="privacy-p">
		AFL follows the Association of Fundraising Professional's (AFP) Ethical Guidelines to the Code of Ethical Principles and Standards of Professional Practice. Occasionally, AFL does exchange or rent mail lists to like-minded organizations through bonded third-party vendors. From time to time, HRC may partner with for-profit companies to provide you with special offers available to members, such as our AFL affinity credit card or special offers on insurance.  These organizations are never given direct access to AFL’s membership database. AFL itself screens each mailing before we allow it to be sent to our membership. Information pertaining to current AFL board members, major donors, Federal Club members, Partners, and/or $250+ donors is never — under any circumstance — released to external entities for the purpose of list rentals or exchanges.
	</p>
	<p class="privacy-p">
		Should you not wish your information to be shared with or sold to other organizations, or to receive offers for member benefits, you may opt out at any time by contacting us at our Member Services Department mailing address below, or by emailing us at ---
	</p>
	<p class="privacy-p">
		We also may be required to release information if required to do so by law or if, in our sole discretion, such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our web site, AFL, our officers, directors, employees, members, other users, and/or the public.
